# Implementing algorithms using TDD

Playgroung for practicing TDD as a tool to implement various algorithms.
Main source of algorithms is the [Main source of algorithms is the](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) ,
but it also features some puzzles found on the internet or [Codility](https://codility.com/).

## Goal

The main purpose of this work is to understand how (or if) helps to design and implement algorithms.

The main findings so far are the following.

- TDD vastly helps implementing algorithms once we have a general idea on how the algorithm should work
- TDD feedback loop helps to arrive at the correct sollution, one step at a time. It does not, however, 
help to arrive at the most efficient sollution, time and memory-wise. 
- Hence, it is up to think about a developer to come up  with (and keep thinking as their go) the expected sollution.
TDD helps to sail safely from the problem to the sollution land, but it's the developer's job to know 
the direction and constantly keep correcting it.
