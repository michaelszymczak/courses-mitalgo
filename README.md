# Implementing algorithms using TDD

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaelszymczak/courses-mitalgo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelszymczak/courses-mitalgo)

Playground for practicing TDD as a tool to implement various algorithms.
Main source of algorithms is the [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) ,
but it also features some puzzles found on the internet, [Codility](https://codility.com/) etc.

## Goal

The main purpose of this work is to understand how (or if) TDD helps to design and implement algorithms.

The main findings so far are the following.

- TDD vastly helps implementing algorithms once we have a general idea on how the algorithm should work
- TDD feedback loop helps to arrive at the correct solution, one step at a time. It does not, however
help to arrive at the most efficient solution, time and memory-wise. 
- Hence, it is up to the developer to come up  with (and keep thinking about as their go) the expected solution.
TDD helps to sail safely from the problem to the solution land, but it's the developer's job to know 
the direction and constantly keep correcting it.
